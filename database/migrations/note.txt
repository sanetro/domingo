Error 1.

"SQLSTATE[HY000] [1045] Access denied for user 'root'@'localhost'
(using password: NO) (SQL: select * from information_schema.tables
where table_schema = domingo and table_name = migrations and table_type

Check connection between artisan and mysql database. Set up .env file.
Host, password, user, etc. must be equals. Next type:

php artisan config:cache
php artisan cache:clear
php artisan migrate

It should works
